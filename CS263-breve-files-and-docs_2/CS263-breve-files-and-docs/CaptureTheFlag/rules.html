Below are the rules and instructions for running a Capture the Flag tournament in 
breve.  See the sample file 
<a href="CaptureTheFlagTemplate.tz">CaptureTheFlagTemplate.tz</a> for an sample 
tournament with two simple team strategies.
<p>
<ul>
<li>You'll need to <a href="CaptureTheFlag.tar.gz">download the Capture the Flag simulation files</a>.
<p>
<li>Two teams of 10 players compete, the Reds and the Blues.</li>
<p>
<li>Each team has a home-side&mdash;Blues on the negative side of the X-axis, Reds on the positive side.</li>
<p>
<li>If a player is tagged offsides, the player is sent to jail.</li>
<p>
<li>If a player tags the jail on the other team's side, all of the jailed teammates are freed.  The freed teammates are automatically zapped back to random locations on their home-side ("free walkbacks").  The agent that tagged the jail does not automatically return home.</li>
<p>
<li>Agent's cannot move their own team's flag.</li>
<p>
<li>The game is over when one of the following conditions has been met:</li>
<ul>
<li>one team's flag has been carried to the other team's side
<li>all players from one team have been captured
<li>500 simulated seconds have elapsed 
</ul>
<p>
<li>The winning team is the team that:
<ul>
<li>captures the other team's flag; or, 
<li>the one that captures all of the other team's opponents; or,
<li>if neither of the above conditions are met, then the winning team is the one which has possession of its opponent's flag for the larger portion of the game.
</ul>
<p>
<li>The results of the competition are printed to the output log.</li>
<p>
<li>Your entry into the competition should be a single breve class, a subclass of "CaptureTheFlagPlayer" with a unique name.</li>
<p>
<li>Your team will arbitrarily be assigned to be the red or blue players.  Blue players have the team number "0" and live on the negative side of the X-axis.  Red players have the team number "1" and live  on the positive side of the X-axis.</li>
<p>
<li>Agents can execute the following action methods:</li>
<ul>
<li>turn-left: turns the agent slightly to the left. 
<li>turn-right: turns the agent slightly to the right. 
<li>set-speed to X: sets the speed of the agent on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0. 
</ul>
<p>
<li>Agents can execute the following methods to get sensor information:</li>
<ul>
<li>get-id-number: returns a unique number between 0 and 9 for each agent on the team.  You can use this to assign different tasks to different agents (for example: offense, flag guard and jail guard).
<li>sense-my-team: returns a list of the players on the agent's team in the agent's sensor range. 
<li>sense-other-team: returns a list of the players on the other team in the agent's sensor range. 
<li>sense-my-flag: returns a single object&mdash;the flag of the agent's team, if it is in the sensor range. 
<li>sense-other-flag: returns a single object&mdash;the flag of the other team, if it is in the sensor range.   
<li>sense-my-jail: returns a single object&mdash;the jail where your teammates are being held, if it is in the  sensor range.  This is the jail you want to get to in order to free your teammates. 
<li> sense-other-jail: returns a single object&mdash;the jail where the other team's players are being held, if it is  in the sensor range.  This is the jail you want to defend. 
<li>get-my-home-location: returns a vector, the closest point to the agent on the agent's home-side.
<li>get-angle-to <i>vector</i>: returns a number representing, in radians, the angle to the 
specified point.  A positive number indicates that the point is to right of the agent,
a negative number indicates that the point is to the left.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Given an object, be it a player, a flag or a jail, the following method can be used:</li>
<ul>
<li>get-location: returns the location of an object.
</ul>
<p>
<li>The CaptureTheFlagController class responds to the following useful methods:
<ul>
<li>get-time: returns the current time in simulated seconds.  Since the game is only 
500.0 seconds long, you may wish to modify agent behaviors based on the current time.
<li>get-jailed-red-count: returns the number of Red agents in jail.
<li>get-jailed-blue-count: returns the number of Blue agents in jail.
</ul>
<p>
<li>To run a match between two strategies:
<ul>
<li>Edit the file Tournament.tz (included with the download files).
<li>Include the proper source files with "@use" lines
<li>Change the two "new" lines (16 &amp; 18) to create the proper object types.  
<li>Run the simulation!
</ul>
</ul>
