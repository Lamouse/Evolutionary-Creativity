BraitenbergTutorial.pdf
	
	An introduction to autonomous agents and the breve programming
	environment.  Uses the "Braitenberg" classes included in breve 
	1.9.

WUBWorld_1

	A breve simulation introducing "WUBWorld", where students can
	program autonomous agents to interact with a dynamic environment.
	In this first version, students learn to direct the agent to 
	collect pieces of food.

WUBWorld_2

	An update to WUBWorld which introduces obstacles and enemies 
	into the environment.  The agent must now eat food in order to
	survive, while avoiding enemies and navigating around obstacles.

WUBWorld_3

	A version of WUBWorld which includes code for building neural
	networks.  It also allows the agents to attack enemies by 
	firing towards them.  Students can use the neuron class to make
	decisions about when to attack or how to move. 
	
WUBWorld_4
	
	The final update to WUBWorld introduces a whole mess of 
	complications: smarter enemies, enemy rebirth, and deadly "shock 
	waves".  To cope with the more complicated world, agents are 
	given the ability to evolve.  When an agent dies, it can be 
	reborn, selecting traits and behaviors from more successful 
	agents.

CaptureTheFlag

	A two-team multi-agent version of the game "Capture The Flag".
	Students apply the AI techniques learned with WUBWorld in order
	to create effective Capture The Flag players.
