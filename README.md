##Evolutionary Creativity

When Darwin published his theories about evolution, he presented two key mechanisms responsible for the evolution, the natural selection and the sexual selection. While natural selection has widely accepted, the sexual selection has highly criticised. It was only after the presentation of a few works supporting the theories defended by Darwin, of which highlights the works of Fisher and Zahavi, that the sexual selection began to be accepted by the scientific community. In the last decades, other matter that have intrigued the scientific community is the cooperative behaviours seen in flock. \emph{Why do several individuals join a herd? And how to simulate these flocking behaviours?} Some works were presented indicating the greatest benefits for an individual join a flock instead of surviving by itself. Others authors, among which Reynolds, suggested that the flocking behaviour emerges through simple motion rules in each individual. Decades later, algorithms combining the ideas from evolution and flocking behaviour were presented. In these algorithms the motion rule of each individual evolves over generations.

Inspired in these algorithms, in this dissertation is proposed a new algorithm, which inserts in these hybrid models the ideas from sexual selection, in particular mate choice. The proposed algorithm combines the ideas from algorithms of flocking behaviour with the ideas of a variant of evolutionary algorithms that uses mate choice instead of the traditional methods. In the end, the emergence of a flocking behaviour is expected and the effects of using mate choice instead of the traditional approaches are analysed.

The objective of this project is to combine the ideas from algorithms of flocking behavior with the ideas of a variant of evolutionary algorithms, that uses mate choice instead of the traditional methods. 

Three variants of this algorithm are available of the file BOID_v2.0. These variants are similar except in the representation of each genotype and in the variant operators since they depend on the representation.

##Installation

This program runs in BREVE simulation environment and therefore it's necessary to have the BREVE installed to run this project. BREVE is available free in [BREVE](http://www.spiderland.org/s/), also some versions are available within this repository in the folder Software.
